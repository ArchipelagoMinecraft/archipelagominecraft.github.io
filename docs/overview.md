## Summary

This is a total rewrite of the original Archipelago client for Minecraft.
The goal is to provide a core foundation of tools for writing Minecraft vanilla and modpack implementations,
focusing on futureproof maintainability, as well as modularity and extendability.

Currently, this project is in a planning/pre-production phase, with no release date.

Priority is currently being placed on one extendable implementation for NeoForge 1.21.8.
Backports to older versions and loaders will be created by request later down the line.

Feel free to [contact us](/docs/contact) with any feedback you might have.
If you'd like to contribute, definitely reach out.

Also, feel free to check out the [Archipelago Minecraft GitHub organization](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMinecraft).

## Goals

### Extendability

The APWorld and the Minecraft Archipelago client are designed to be completely modular.
Grab the APWorld template, export your modpack's raw data, and pick which batteries to include.
The Minecraft client is versatile and built to be portable.
<br />See [Architecture Overview](/docs/architecture).

### Robust Tooling

**An `.apmcbundle` patch with mod files** generated by the APWorld,
for running headless servers and patching local instances.
<br />See [Archipelago Architecture](/docs/category/archipelago-architecture).

**KubeJS support** integrates Archipelago with an expressive, easy-to-use JavaScript API.
<br />See [KubeJS](/docs/architecture/client/kubejs).

**One extendable core Minecraft client**,
tailored for portability between modpacks for different mod loaders and game versions.
<br />See [Client Architecture](/docs/category/client-architecture).

**A featureful vanilla implementation** that keeps parity with the original randomizer,
also adding many new features and fixing specific gameplay problems.
<br />See [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap).
