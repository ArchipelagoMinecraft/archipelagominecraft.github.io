# Overview

:::warning

This project is undergoing heavy development. Plans and documentation may change on a whim!

:::

This is a total rewrite of the original Archipelago client for Minecraft.
The goal is to provide a core foundation of tools for writing vanilla and modpack implementations for Minecraft,
focusing on long-term maintainability, modularity, flexibility and extendability.

Currently, this project is in a planning/pre-production phase, with no release date.

## Goals

- **One core engine, ported to many versions and mod loaders.** The core client mod will be mostly generic. It's designed
with simplicity in mind, making it viable to maintain many NeoForge/Forge/Fabric ports with one unified codebase.
  - Currently planned is &gt;=1.16, &lt;=1.21.8, with the latest version most prioritized for the vanilla implementation.
  - Legacy/beta support should be considered on an individual basis for the future (ie. &lt;=1.7.10).
- **Extendable framework**. This client will offer a flexible and solid developer experience.
  - **An APWorld template** will be provided for bootstrapping new modpacks.
    - *A simpler way of expressing very complicated logic*,
    which would be especially helpful for supporting massive modpacks with hundreds of quests and items.
  - **`.apmc` files** generated by the APWorld will bundle
  server/client assets, randomizer data, mod/modpack links and connection details in a neat archive for easy installation.
  - **KubeJS support** will be provided as an addon on top of the Archipelago client mod,
  to assist with implementing client hooks and randomizer functionality.
    - Version support will be limited to versions KubeJS supports.
  - **The core client is built to be extended**, so if you prefer to write a Java mod for your implementation, you can.
- **A featureful, robust vanilla implementation.**
