## Summary

This is a total rewrite of the original Archipelago client for Minecraft.
The goal is to provide a core foundation of tools for writing Minecraft vanilla and modpack implementations,
focusing on long-term maintainability, modularity, flexibility and extendability.

Currently, this project is in a planning/pre-production phase, with no release date.

Priority is currently placed on one extendable implementation for 1.21.8.
Backports to older versions and loaders will be created on request later down the line.

## Goals

### Extendability

The APWorld and the Minecraft Archipelago client are designed to be completely modular.
Grab the APWorld template, export your modpack's raw data, and pick which batteries to include.
The Minecraft client is versatile and built to be portable.
<br />See [Architecture Overview](/docs/architecture).

### Robust Tooling

**An `.apmcbundle` patch with mod files** generated by the APWorld,
for running headless servers and patching local instances.
<br />See [Archipelago Architecture](/docs/category/archipelago-architecture).

**KubeJS support** integrates Archipelago with an expressive, easy-to-use JavaScript API.
<br />See [KubeJS](/docs/architecture/client/kubejs).

**One extendable core Minecraft client**,
tailored for portability between modpacks for different mod loaders and game versions.
<br />See [Client Architecture](/docs/category/client-architecture).

**A featureful vanilla implementation** that keeps parity with the original randomizer,
also adding many new features and fixing specific gameplay problems.
<br />See [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap).
