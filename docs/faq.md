## What's the basic TL;DR of this project?

This is a project that aims to make the Minecraft randomizer more flexible for a variety of different randomizers,
including vanilla and modpack implementations.

By rewriting the randomizer in a more flexible way, it's futureproof and easily extendable.
Another goal is to support a wide variety of versions and mod loaders for different modpacks to add to.
These goals require a well-designed framework.

## Who's working on this?

Currently:
- `@Treeways` working on this wiki and researching the APWorld design
- `@LelouBil` working on the initial client code
- `@studkid` for spearheading the unofficial implementation, and heavily inspiring this project

Feel free to check out our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMinecraft).

Thanks to everyone who's given us support and feedback over the course of development!

## When will this be done?

When it's done, it's done. There's too much to be done; it's impossible to tell right now.

## How can I help?

Thanks for asking.
Feel free to skim through the documentation - there is plenty to work on at the moment.

If you'd rather work with modpacks later on,
you can let us know what mod loader/version you want to see a backport for.

If you think you could help, let us know what you want to work on in [our Discord thread](/docs/contact).
We are very receptive!

## Will you consolidate with the current NeoForge fork of KonoTyran's randomizer?

These two clients are very different under the hood, and would require
an extraordinary amount of effort to port to the new architecture we've come up with.

Nevertheless, we highly respect the current maintainers of the KonoTyran fork for their effort,
and we're very excited to see the release of their mod when it's ready.
They're currently working on supporting Archipelago 0.6.2, so please look forward to it!

One of our main goals for the new randomizer is to maintain full parity with the original randomizer,
while adding on new features, better version support, and further improvements on a futureproof base implementation.

See the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap) for more details.

## How do I play/where can I find more about the original randomizer?

Please see the
[AP Minecraft FAQ Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AMcototDovob8YJ7w4UFKAiUMCV21uQjJqzw_dr-sJQ/).

## Could you add a new feature?

Definitely!

We'd be happy to add new vanilla features and provide additional modded support.
Check out our [roadmap](/docs/roadmap).

Please [contact us](/docs/contact) with any ideas you might have.
