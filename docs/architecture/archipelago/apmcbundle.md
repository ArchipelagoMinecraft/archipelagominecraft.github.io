# `.apmcbundle`

The `.apmcbundle` file is generated by the APWorld upon generation.

It contains [`mcman`](https://github.com/ParadigmMC/mcman)-compatible server file configuration,
a link to the exact modpack to download (for both the client and server packs),
and a link to a [`packwiz`](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) modpack for Archipelago overrides,
such as mod versions and KubeJS integration scripts.

It also contains server connection details and the output data,
created after generation.

## File Structure

Will be documented sooner than later.

[//]: # (TODO)

:::info
Please do not distribute other people's modpacks or jarmods in your overrides folder
without explicit permission from their owners first. This system is designed to
patch in your modifications separately from any original work.

Please show respect for developers and their intellectual property by
downloading mods from their respective platforms proper.
Archipelago takes redistribution very seriously.
